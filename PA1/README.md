Project Assignment: Divide and Conquer vs Linear search Lottery project

Objective: Submit first coding project assignment to ensure everything is working. The project also compares Divide and Conquer search (Binary Search in this case) to a linear search. (Additionally, I used a merge sort to sort the lottery tickets as to use more Divide and Conquer algorithms).

The project had us sort a bunch of lottery numbers to test out a lottery winner program. The program passed all the test cases Dr.steingberg gaves us in the runner file.

NOTE: There may be a case in which the 5th case comes out as Not passed. This is due to a mathematical issue in the runner file. There were two runner files provided in this file. I used the second one which worked for my 5th case.
