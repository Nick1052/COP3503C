Objective: Create a red and black tree structure that maintains balance as insertion, and deletions occur.

I created a Red and Black tree utilizing only one Node class that had a Nil Node attribute (boolean isNil). The red and black tree worked successfully as the runner file provided by professor Dr. Steinberg passed all the test cases. The tree successfully maintains balance when inserting and deleting, proving to be an effective storage method.

Notes: The tree is currently set to take in Strings as the Key value. Although I suspect since I used generics it should be compatible with other types. Assuming it doesn't, the fix would be simply to change the comparisons to the proper type. Everything else can remain the same.
